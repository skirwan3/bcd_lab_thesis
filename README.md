# bcd_lab_thesis
This R script was written while completing my senior thesis in the BCD Lab at the University of Florida and served a few purposes:
1. To aggregate participants' individual behavioral data files
2. To calculate behavioral measures (Hit Rates, Miss Rates, False Alarm Rates, Correct Rejection Rates, Overall Accuracy)
3. To calculate discrimination indices (AUC ROC, D Prime)

These clean data sets were then exported and analyzed in SPSS. I've since added ANOVA analyses at the end of the script.

Of note, the behavioral data was one piece of the overall analysis - the EEG data for the study was collected, processed and analyzed using Net Station and SPSS.
